# Real Estate Platform API Schema

This repository contains the OpenAPI 3.0.3 schema definition for the Real Estate Platform API.

## What is this?

This file is a blueprint of our API. It describes all the available endpoints, the operations you can perform on them (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the expected request and response formats, authentication methods, and more.

**This file is not a working API itself.** It's a specification that can be used for various purposes, such as:

* **Documentation:** Tools like Swagger UI can consume this file to generate interactive API documentation.
* **Code Generation:** Server stubs and client libraries in various programming languages can be automatically generated from this schema.
* **Testing:** Automated tests can be created based on the defined contracts.

## How to view this schema

The easiest way to visualize and explore this API schema is by using an online Swagger Editor:

1.  Go to the official Swagger Editor website: [https://editor.swagger.io/](https://editor.swagger.io/)
2.  **Copy the entire content of this schema file (the .yaml).
3.  **Paste the copied content** directly into the Swagger Editor. The editor will parse the schema and display it in a user-friendly, interactive format.

Within the Swagger Editor, you'll be able to:

* Browse the different API endpoints.
* See the details of each operation (parameters, request bodies, responses).
* View example requests and responses.

This schema provides a clear and comprehensive overview of how to interact with the Real Estate Platform API once it is implemented.
